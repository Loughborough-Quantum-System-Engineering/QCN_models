# QCN_models
This repository is for all SysML v1 models of QKD usecases developed under the Loughborough Quantum Systems Engineering research group (https://www.lboro-qse.org/).
There are currently three models under development: 
- mdi_qkd_usecase: Use case of measurement device independent QKD protocol combined with one-time-pad.
- satellite_usecase: Use case of QKD with free space qubit transmission.
- qcn: Models that are used in the ASEC 2025 paper.

All models are developed using the Magic System of Systems Architect
